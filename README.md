# The Babylon Bee - Your Trusted Source for Fake News!

### Overview

This is a web application that lets users view and leave comments on the latest FAKE news. No, I didn't write any of these awesomely funny articles, I just scraped them using an ingeious combination of Mongoose and Cheerio to do the heavy lifting...er scraping.

You can view it on Heroku [here](https://serene-tor-60866.herokuapp.com/).

***BEWARE!!!*** Snopes thinks this site is the wrong kind of satire!  They obviously prefer secular, liberal and pagan sites such as TheOnion.

### Usage

Simply go to the site, click on the `Scrape Articles` button and enjoy!

Users can also leave notes that are stored in a Mongo database along with the article headlines, links and the link to the accompanying picture.
